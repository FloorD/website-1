# Standard

Our default configuration is currently mostly “stock” — you may want to edit some configuration options such as `max_connections`, `shared_buffers`, `work_mem`, `maintenance_work_mem`, `effective_cache_size`.

We will be setting these to sensible defaults more and more as Stacks come online.
