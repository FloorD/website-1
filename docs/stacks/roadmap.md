Tembo is working hard to build a useful set of "Tembo Stacks" for a number of Postgres use cases.

Initial Stacks may include:

- Data Warehouse — for analytical data use case
- Message queue system (Redis)
- Data warehouse (Snowflake)
- ML training and serving (Pinecone)
- Time series data (Timescale)
- Full-text search (Elastic)
- Real-time analytics (Couchbase)
- GraphQL layer (Hasura)
